The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Pretty is better than ugly.
Explicit is metter than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Plan is better than chipboard.
Sparse is better than dense.
Legibility/Readability counts.
Special cases are not special enough to break the rules.
Though practicality trumps purity.
Error might never pass through silently.
Unless they  are explicitly silenced.
Facing ambiguity, refuse the temptation of guessing.
There might be one -- and only one -- obvious mode of doing something.
Although this mode may not be obvious at first look unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is frequently better than *exactly* now
If the implementation is hard to explain, then it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, then it's a good idea.
Namespaces are a great idea -- let's more of those.
